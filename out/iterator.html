And, <code>ruby_block</code> existed. However, <code>BLOCK</code> understands by the block and doesn't understand whether existence [surukara] and [i] are blocks where it was piled up for me with the delimitation of the method call by me because it is piled up regardless.

Six stack frames other than <code>CREF</code> and <code>BLOCK</code> are preserved by that token. Because it is possible to substitute it with <code>ruby_frame-&gt; cbase</code>, <code>CREF</code> need not be piled up. </p> <p>I want to confirm three points about the mechanism of the push again. <code>BLOCK</code> also must put [beta] in the stack and secure. <code>FRAME</code> at the time of this must be copied onto <code>BLOCK</code> wholly. <code>BLOCK</code> is the previous unlike a lot of other stack frame structures Have pointer <code>(prev)</code> to <code>BLOCK</code>. </p> <p>It doesn't explain now because the flag variously used with <code>POP_BLOCK()</code> is not understood if it doesn't see collectively after mounting <code>Proc</code> will be seen later. </p> <p>Well, it seems certainly to be a little heavy though it is a story that <code>BLOCK</code> is heavy. When the inside is seen, <code>new_blktag()</code> <code>malloc()s, and </code>stores a large amount of members. However, after comparing <code>PUSH_ITER()</code>, it is a mother-of-pearl way that does a final judgment. </p> <h4><code>PUSH_ITER()</code></h4> <p class="caption">- <code>PUSH_ITER() POP_ITER()</code></p> <pre class="longlist">

</pre> <p>Here seems to be obviously light. Using it also is only a stack area, and has only two members.

For instance, the evaluation of the argument of [itere-tamesoddo] is got in. There is a possibility to be used with ours the block piled up now being misunderstood while the.. evaluating it because the call of the method must be likely to be in that it.

</pre> <p>As you see, it substitutes it secretly to the one that most stack frames were memorized in <code>ruby_block</code>.

</pre> <p>It is these operation of <code>BLOCK</code> most not to understand division. Whether it saves or it costs it in pop is not understood well. It returns to the origin finally, the second sentence might because be on earth connected with what result though it is possible to understand pairing of the first sentence with the third sentence. </p> <p>It is "Return to <code>ruby_block</code> when the block is piled up. " as for the conclusion about which it variously thinks in a word. Because it only has to return state of stack frame to [itere-ta] and [hayousuru] at point that makes block because it is syntax that returns to frame beforeAnd, the value of <code>ruby_block</code> when the block was made must have been <code>block-&gt; prev</code>. Therefore, it is in <code>prev</code>. </p> <p>Moreover, it can do nothing but be said to the doubt "May I assume that I always start one of the <code>ruby_block</code> heads?", "You may assume it so as <code>rb_yield_0()</code> side". It is because of work on the side where the block is prepared piling up the block that should start on top of <code>ruby_block</code>, and no work of <code>rb_yield_0()</code>. </p> <p>It is <code>BEGIN_CALLARGS</code> that the one example did in the preceding chapter. The block that should not be used comes to the head of the stack being piled up the block by two steps when the [itere-ta] call does the cascade. Therefore, the check was purposely put and it removed it sideways. </p> <h4><code>VARS</code></h4> <p>Incidently, contents of <code>PUSH_VARS()</code> and <code>POP_VARS()</code> still think that it doesn't see.

</pre> <p>Because this doesn't pile up the novel structure, either saying, "Save and return" is near. <code>PUSH_VARS()</code> is actually only used in <code>rb_yield_0()</code> to save the value. It is in this line that actually prepares <code>ruby_dyna_vars</code>. </p> <pre class="emlist">

The entry hung on the way should be able to be inserted in the parser to adjust the list to one on the way of the list. However, if the header has adhered to the interior, it is good at the first one scope and is not possible to insert it (Figure 5). It returns to the head to operate it like this (To begin with, it is difficult), all links are traced or if the <code>prev</code> link is not put, it doesn't become it.

</pre> <p>Making the <code>Proc</code> object is unexpectedly easy. (A)The area of the <code>Proc</code> object is secured between painful (B), and initialization ends, too. <code>Data_Make_Struct()</code> is a simple macro that does <code>malloc()</code> and <code>Data_Wrap_Struct()</code> at the same time. </p> <p>The problem is subsequent. </p> <ul> <li><code>frame_dup()</code></li> <li><code>blk_copy_prev()</code></li> <li><code>FL_SET(vars, DVAR_DONT_RECYCLE)</code></li> <li><code>scope_dup()</code></li> </ul> <p>These four purposes are all the same.

Here, "All" includes even <code>prev</code> and is all. Everything is <code>malloc()ed, the </code>stack frame piled up there is copied, and the reproduction is made. When <code>VARS</code> is usual, the compulsion collection is done with <code>rb_gc_force_recycle()</code>, and it also : simultaneously with <code>POP</code> It is stopped putting up the <code>DVAR_DONT_RECYCLE</code> flag. [Nadona], [doda]. It indeed gave it up. </p> <p>Why should I do such a terrific thing?<code>Proc</code> because of being able to live long more than the method of the making origin it is different from [itere-taburokku]. And, it is <code>FRAME</code> that the method ended secured for the machine stack It can be expected that it was easy what result to become if <code>local_vars</code> of <code>ITER</code> and <code>SCOPE</code> became invalid, and the memory that had become invalid was used back (example solution: Embarrassed it. )</p> <p>Still, it doesn't seem to go well though it thought cannot this of the use of same <code>FRAME</code> at least with two or more <code>Proc</code> because the pointer has been saved in the local variable like <code>old_frame</code> etc.The labor should be used to devise the allocation of everything from the beginning for instance with <code>malloc()</code> etc. if it has a hard time anyway. </p> <p>However, the author heartily thinks that he or she often moves at such a speed though it is done that it is terrible in the so much. It is what became an indeed good age. </p> <h3>Floatage frame</h3> <p>I will think, "All frames are reproduced" then in massage Rina's a little more in detail in a single phrase though it has put in order a little while ago. The points are the following two points. </p> <ul> <li>How is everything reproduced?</li> <li>Is everything why reproduced?</li> </ul> <p>Then, let's start first from the summary of the storage form of each stack frame. </p> <table> <tr><td>Frame<td><td>Storage form<td><td><code>Prev</code> pointer<td></tr> <tr><td><code>FRAME</code><td><td>Stack<td><td>It is. <td></tr> <tr><td><code>SCOPE</code><td><td>Stack<td><td>None<td></tr> <tr><td><code>local_tbl</code><td><td>Heap<td><td><td></tr> <tr><td><code>local_vars</code><td><td>Stack<td><td><td></tr> <tr><td><code>VARS</code><td><td>Heap<td><td>None<td></tr> <tr><td><code>BLOCK</code><td><td>Stack<td><td>It is. <td></tr> </table> <p> <code>CLASS CREF ITER</code> is unnecessary at this. Do not <code>rb_gc_force_recycle()</code> (It is not possible to do), and with <code>CREF</code> even if you make a mistake because <code>CLASS</code> is a general Ruby object The reason for <code>ITER</code> is that ending for already if an each occasion value is stored in <code>FRAME</code>. Four frames that exist in this table are important because of having many times to change and to refer. Three of the remainder are not so. </p> <p>And, it is a story how to reproduce everything. No "<code>Malloc()</code>. " even if it is said how of course. It is a problem how to reproduce "All". Because there is a frame without the <code>prev</code> pointer though I want you to see the table. In a word, the link cannot be traced. If so, how is everything reproduced?</p> <p>The sleight of hand is quite used for this. Let's take it as an example of <code>SCOPE</code>. First of all, because the function named <code>scope_dup()</code> was used to reproduce <code>SCOPE</code> a little while ago, let's see it. </p> <p class="caption">- Only the <code>scope_dup()</code> head :. </p> <pre class="longlist">

</pre> <p>It is when the <code>SCOPE_DONT_RECYCLE</code> flag stands in present <code>SCOPE(ruby_scope)</code><code></code> when doing in pop when the previous one <code>SCOPE(_old)</code><code></code> is <code>scope_dup()ed. </code>In a word, <code>SCOPE_DONT_RECYCLE</code> adheres to this. Because flag is spread in place in which it does so and it does in pop one by one (Figure 7)</p> <p class="image"> <img src="http://i.loveruby.net/ja/rhg/book/images/ch_iterator_flaginfect.jpg" alt="(flaginfect)"><br>Figure 7: Spread of flag</p> <p>Because <code>VARS</code> doesn't have the <code>prev</code> pointer, either the flag named <code>DVAR_DONT_RECYCLE</code> is spread by using the same technique. <p>Next, let's think about the second point and "Is everything why reproduced?". If <code>Proc</code> is made, that Everything might not have to be copied including even <code>SCOPE</code> ahead of that of any however though it is understood to be able to refer back to the local variable of <code>SCOPE</code>. </p> <p>The answer has been understood a minute ago though the author is worried about good when this answer is not understood and recent is written very on around the third when he or she says honestly. I want you to see the following program. </p> <pre class="emlist">
