First of all, a detailed making will be seen about this <code>st_table</code> in this chapter. </p> <h3>Outline</h3> <p>It has already been said that <code>st_table</code> is a hush table. Then, the hush table is a data structure that records one a couple of correspondence when a variety of saying. The correspondence of the one to one is a variable identifier, , for instance, the value, a function name, and the substance, etc.</p> <p>However, it is possible to show of course for the one to one excluding the hush table. For instance, you may use the list of the following structures. </p> <pre class="emlist">
struct entry { ID key; VALUE val; struct entry *next; /* The following entry is indicated */. };
</pre> <p>However, this method is "It is slow. "It is necessary to haul in the link the badness 1000 times and to look for if there are 1000 lists. In a word, the retrieval time becomes long in proportion to the number of elements. This is unpalatable, and various speed-up methods have been devised from old. The hush table is one of such the techniques. There is ..can speed-up.. meaning rather than "And, it is not good in case of not being" the hush table in a word. </p> <p>Well, this library is not a waited original and because it sees <code>st_table</code> original it. </p> <p class="caption">- Credit of <code>st.c</code></p> <pre class="longlist">

</pre> <p>It is ……, and it is so. </p> <p>By the way, judging from the comment on other versions found with Google, <code>St_table</code> seems to be abbreviation of STring TABLE. However, with the contents of a letter named general purpose …… though thought that only the circle is contradicted in string. </p> <h4>What is the hush table?</h4> <p>Those who think about the hush table are long agess. Unpalatable The array with the length of n piece is prepared. For instance, Let's assume n=64 (Figure 1). </p> <p class="image"> <img src="http://i.loveruby.net/ja/rhg/book/images/ch_name_array.jpg" alt="(array)"><br>Figure 1: Array</p> <p>And, 0- from the key integer within the range of n-1 (0-63) function that obtains i F is prepared. This F is called a hash function. F is always the same as the same key Return i. For instance, if the key is divided by 64 if assumable, the key is sure to become 0-63 too much only with the positive integer. Therefore, this calculating formula is a function It is possible to become f. </p> <p>To the key when you record the relation F is called Index about the prepared array for i It only has to put the value in i (Figure 2). Saying that the key will be converted into the integer somehow or other because it is the super-high-speed if it is an index to [yousuruni] and the array access is a basis of the idea. </p> <p class="image"> <img src="http://i.loveruby.net/ja/rhg/book/images/ch_name_aset.jpg" alt="(aset)"><br>Figure 2: It sets it in the array. </p> <p>However, the world aspect has a fatal problem in this idea because there is no along good story. Absolutely when you try to record 64 relations or more because n has only 64 now I overlaps. If it is as many as less than 64 pieces, the same index might be allotted to a separate key. A hash function for instance a little while ago The hash value is one in case of <code>"key % 64"</code> by 65 and even 129. the keyThis It is said, "Collision (collision) of the hash value". The method of solving the collision exists ..how many kinds it... </p> <p>For instance, there is a method of putting in the following element when the collision happens. This is called an open house number method (Figure 3). </p> <p class="image"> <img src="http://i.loveruby.net/ja/rhg/book/images/ch_name_nexti.jpg" alt="(nexti)"><br>Figure 3: Open house number method</p> <p>Besides, there is a method of not the use of the array as it is but making each one of the array element the pointer to the link list, too. And, the list ties fast when the collision happens. Here is called a chain method (Figure 4). <code>St_table</code> adopts this chain method. </p> <p class="image"> <img src="http://i.loveruby.net/ja/rhg/book/images/ch_name_chain.jpg" alt="(chain)"><br>Figure 4: Chain method</p> <p>By the way, sets of keys with the possibility to use : when there is prior rapidly It is likely to be able to think about "Hash function in which the collision never happens". Such a function is said, "Perfect hash function". And, there is a tool that makes this perfect hash function for sets of actually arbitrary character strings. GNU gperf is Sole. Mounting the parser of <code>ruby</code> is not …… time when the story is still told though it actually uses this. Continuation will be spoken of this secondarily. </p> <h3>Data structure</h3> <p>It enters an actual source code here. First of all, you should read from data if there are data and a code as written by the introductory chapter. The data type that <code>st_table</code> uses is shown as follows. </p> <p class="caption">- <code>st_table</code></p> <pre class="longlist">
9 typedef struct st_table st_table; 16 struct st_table { 17 struct st_hash_type *type; 18 int num_bins; /* number */ of slots 19 Int num_

</pre> <p> <code>St_table</code> is a structure of the table of the main, and the holder by which <code>st_table_entry</code> stores one value. Naturally, this is a link list because there is a member named <code>next</code> in <code>st_table_entry</code>. It is a part of the chain of the chain method. I would like you to confirm the role first comparing other parts to Figure 5 because it will explain this later ..this.. though the type named <code>st_hash_type</code> is used. </p> <p class="image"> <img src="http://i.loveruby.net/ja/rhg/book/images/ch_name_sttable.jpg" alt="(sttable)"><br>Figure 5: Data structure of <code>st_table</code></p> <p>Then, <code>st_hash_type</code> is annotated. </p> <p class="caption">- <code>struct st_hash_type</code></p> <pre class="longlist">
11 struct st_hash_type { 12 int (*compare)(); /* comparison function */ 13 Int (*hash) (); /* hash function */ 14
(st.h) </pre> <p>Because it is still Chapter 3, I will see anyway a little politely. </p> <pre class="emlist">
int (*compare)()
</pre> <p>"Pointer to the function that returns <code>int</code>" to say nothing of ..drinking.. [bu] Member <code>compare</code> of the type is shown. <code>Hash</code> is also similar. It substitutes it for such a variable as follows. </p> <pre class="emlist">
int great_function(int n) {
/* ToDo: */ that does something it terrible Return n;
}
{
int (*f)(); f = great_function; </pre> <p>It calls it as follows. </p> <pre class="emlist">
(*f)(7);
}
</pre> <p>Let's return to the explanation of <code>st_hash_type</code> here. <code>Hash</code> is the above-mentioned hash function among <code>hash compare</code> and 2 members F is shown. </p> <p>It is a function that judges other <code>compare</code> is whether the key is the same. It is the same hush value in the chain method Two or more elements might have entered n. To know whether it is what any of the element really requests, the comparison function that can be completely trusted this time is needed. The function for that is <code>compare</code>. </p> <p>This <code>st_hash_type</code> is a quite good generalizing technique. The stored key cannot be specified for the hush table ..what type it is... For instance, in <code>ruby</code> It seems to be foolish to write the hush of quite the same mechanism as of each though <code>ID･char*･VALUE</code><code></code><code></code> is used as a key to <code>st_table</code>. The majority of codes like the memory allocation and the crash sensing, etc. because of the same it is only a small portion like the hash function etc. that changes even if the type of the key is different. Bundling as the function, and part where mounting is different according to the type there "will receive the pointer to it and use". As a result, it is possible to spend by using mounting the hush table that has the majority of the code. </p> <p>Such a mechanism is unnecessary because it carries by joining the procedure to the object to begin with when it is an object-oriented language. Or, is it correct with such a mechanism as a function of the language?</p> <h3>Example of <code>st_hash_type</code></h3> <p>As for the method of using the structure like <code>st_hash_type</code>, between what code it actually passes certainly becomes cramped oppositely as generalizing though it is good. Actually feeling cannot be very gripped if it doesn't see though it doesn't know what function used for <code>hash</code> and <code>compare</code>. If appearing <code>st_init_numtable()</code> is seen, the preceding chapter might be good for it. This is a function that prepares the table for the integer type key. </p> <p class="caption">- <code>st_init_numtable()</code></p> <pre class="longlist">
182 st_table* 183 st_init_numtable() 184 { 185 return st_init_table(&amp;type_numhash); 186 } (st.c)
</pre> <p>It is of the allocation of <code>st_init_table()</code> of the memory of the table and worth a function, and <code>type_numhash</code> is <code>st_hash_type</code> (It is <code>type</code> when saying by the name of the member). Ignorance …… the <code>type_numhash</code> [hato] [i]</p> <p class="caption">- <code>type_numhash</code></p> <pre class="longlist">

</pre> <p>It is very simple. The table that the interpreter of <code>ruby</code> uses roughly uses this <code>type_numhash</code>. </p> <h3><code>st_lookup()</code></h3> <p>Then, I will see the function that uses this structure this time. Seeing from the function for the retrieval is good first.

This function doesn't inspect whether the key has already been registered, and add a new entry unconditionally.
